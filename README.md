**Who am I?**

I am not a neural network. 

I am a machine who recognizes handwritten digits. 

I create update my classification filters as I see a training example with a cumulative mean approach - no backpropagation.

My accuracy is 77% at this moment - but don't underestimate me. I have novelty(or maybe obsolescence :-/).
